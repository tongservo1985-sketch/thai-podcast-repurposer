# Growth Hacking Strategy: The "Viral Transcript" Loop

## 1. The "Powered by OVERLORD" Viral Loop
- **Feature:** Free users get a "Summary Card" (Image) to share on social media.
- **Mechanism:** The bottom of the card contains a QR code and text: *"สรุปโดย OVERLORD AI - ประหยัดเวลาทำคอนเทนต์ 90%"*
- **Goal:** Drive organic awareness every time a creator shares their summary on Facebook/Threads.

## 2. The "Influencer Seed" Program
- Target 50 mid-tier Thai podcasters (1k - 50k followers).
- **Offer:** 500 "Lifetime AI Minutes" in exchange for a "Product Shoutout" or a "Before/After" post showing their workflow speed.
- **Target Niches:** Tech (beartai/Mission to the Moon vibe), Business, Self-Development.

## 3. SEO-Driven Content Pillars (The "Free Tool" Trap)
- Create a free micro-tool: **"Thai Podcast Title Generator"**.
- This tool ranks easily for low-difficulty keywords.
- Capture emails of creators who use the free tool to funnel them into the main AI Transcription product.

## 4. Referral Program (Credit-Based)
- "Invite a fellow podcaster and get 60 minutes of free transcription."
- Double-sided reward: The invitee also gets 30 minutes.
- Implementation via unique referral slugs in the Dashboard.
