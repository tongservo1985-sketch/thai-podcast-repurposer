# Engineering Nuanced Thai Copywriting Prompts

## 1. The Challenge of Thai AI Copywriting
Thai is a high-context language. Standard translation-based prompts often result in "Robot Thai" (ภาษาหุ่นยนต์) which feels stiff, uses unnatural word choices, or fails to use social particles correctly.

## 2. Core Prompting Principles for OVERLORD
- **Contextual Particle Management:** Transcripts are full of "ครับ/ค่ะ/แบบว่า/เอ่อ". The AI must strip these from the source but re-insert them strategically in the output to match the platform's "Vibe".
- **Code-Switching (Thai-English):** For tech/business podcasts, maintain professional English terms (e.g., "Scalability", "Growth Mindset") instead of using awkward Thai translations.
- **Hook-First Structure:** Thai social media users (especially on Facebook and Threads) prioritize the first 2 lines. 

## 3. Persona Definition
The AI acts as a **"Creative Content Lead at a Top Thai Digital Agency"**. It understands the difference between:
- **Facebook:** Informative, community-focused, long-form.
- **Threads/X:** Punchy, opinionated, thread-worthy.
- **TikTok/Reels:** High-energy, curiosity-gap driven.
- **Blog:** SEO-friendly, structured with H1-H3.
